jQuery UI is required by:

* elfinder: https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder#requirements
* jqGrid
* our code: frequentObjects, select2Dev etc.

* everything under Core
* everything under Interactions
* Widgets: everything except accordion, progressbar, selectmenu, spinner, tooltip
* nothing under Effects

To see if any of these are still in use, grep for them, e.g.:

  grep -rl --exclude-dir={merged,templates_c,stat} draggable\(
